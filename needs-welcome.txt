Congratulations! It appears that tw-needs-hook has been successfully installed!

Next Steps: the needs-hook will help you filter you tasks by need-levels.
This can be thought of as "importance" rather than "urgency", and it corresponds
to Mazlow's Hierarchy of Needs". ( link ) 

In order to get started, you first need to assign need:value to all of your tasks.
Fisrt, if you have tags or projects that you can assign a need-value, do so with
a command like;

    task +PENDING proj:home mod need:2

and repeat this process wher you can think of a filter that corresponds to a
need-level. Don't worry about getting this perfect, it's easy to change later.
After you have assigned all that you can, I recommend assigning everything else
a need:4 (for now) with a command like this;

    task +PENDING need.none: mod need:4

or use the new built-in command;

    task check_needs
