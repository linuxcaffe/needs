# taskwarrior-needs-hierarchy
_Persistant filtering based on needs hierarchy (a.k.a. Mazlow Mode)_

CAVEAT: this repository is concept, not code (so far), so if you like the idea, pitch in!
----
The needs-hierarchy extension for taskwarrior is base on a theory proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation". see wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs

The idea for this extension is related (complimentary) to the taskwarrior "context" functionality; a persistant filter that stays inplace until you change it. It is made using mostly exixsting task functionality, and add a new command [+ options]; "needs".
