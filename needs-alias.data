# taskwarrior-needs-hierarchy commad-alias bindings
# to "install" them, include this file from your .taskrc, with a line like;
#
# include ~/.task/needs-alias.data
# (your path/to/file)
#
# These filter aliases are used to temporarily apply the needs-limiting filter,
# but allows tasks that are due today, as well as those until:tomorrow, so
# that while limiting for the most basic needs, you won't miss appointments or
# last-chances to do things, before they are auto-deleted.
#
# used like;
# task :n2 calls list
#
